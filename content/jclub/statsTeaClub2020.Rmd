<!-- December 27th 2019 -->

Reading plan for the 2020 statistics tea club. Starting from January we will go through The Book of Why by Judea Pearl, a (mostly) non-technical introduction to causal inference with graphical models. 

Order the book from [Bookdepository](https://www.bookdepository.com/Book-Why-Judea-Pearl/9780141982410?ref=grid-view&qid=1577477244777&sr=1-1) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/0141982411)
